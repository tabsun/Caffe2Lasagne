# Caffe2Lasagne

This project aims to convert the models trained under caffe env into the ones under Lasagne/Theano.Actually I got most of the code from [Caffe Theano Conversion](https://github.com/an-kumar/caffe-theano-conversion) and modified some of its code to remove pylearn.

If you have any questions about the code, please submit an issue. But the tutorial in CaffeTheanoConversion may be a better choice I think.

##Quick Start

See ./convert_model.py
